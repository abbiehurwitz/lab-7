What was most challenging for me in this lab was the fact that Javascript rarely crashes. Initially I was not testing my code frequently enough and just assuming that there weren’t any problems because my code could run. I frequently assumed that because I wasn’t getting a ton of obvious errors that everything was alright. This ultimately wound up being a mistake and I wound up having to backtrack a lot as a result. Despite this I was very excited to do some work with JavaScript for the first time. It was a completely new experience for me and i could see myself using it again in the future because it pertains to coding a browser, which is something I could find interesting. I did not enjoy JavaScript’s lack of types. I was particularly confused when we needed to make dictionaries but were defining them as vars. While this most likely would be beneficial for a different project for this lab I would have preferred to work in C++. Luckily there were still some similarities between this lab and the original one. For example maps felt very familiar even in the new language which made it more comfortable for me.
